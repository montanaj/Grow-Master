                        "page_text": "INDEX 0,INDEX In your hometown, there is a tradition. There is a man, merely known as the Distributor, who visits every single resident in the city at a point in their lives. No one is sure why or when, and there does not seem to be a pattern, any rhyme or reason to his appearance. Some are visited before they even hit their teenage years, and some adults you know still have not seen the Distributor. There are only two certain facts about this event; one: everyone who lives in this city will, before they die, be visited by the Distributor, and two: when one is visited, they will have to make a choice.\n\nThis choice will ultimately decide what happens to them for the rest of their lives.\n                        Or so they say. Your best friend since elementary school, Lucian, was visited by the Distributor during your junior year of high school. He made his choice, and showed up the next day at school with the surprising news. Visits from the Distributor were sporadic, and so anyone in school who had been visited became quite popular for a time. Those who had already made their Choice wanted to discuss one another’s decisions; there was a sort of enviable exclusivity to this group of people. Everyone else just wanted a secondhand taste of what the Choice was like. Lucian sort of reveled in the attention for a time, while you and Ellen, a recent but fast friend, stood behind him rolling your eyes the entire time.\n                        In private, you both asked Lucian if he felt any different, which he pondered for a while before stating that he believed his allergies were getting better.\n                        There is a sort of unspoken rule that those who had been visited by the Distributor were not supposed to disclose details of the interaction with anyone, so the gossip that filtered through the community was always chockfull of vague generalities and assumptions, but there is a constant in every meeting which everyone knows.\n                        When the Distributor visits someone, they are made to choose between three items.\n                        The items are different for every person, and their significance is not apparent at the beginning. You are told that there is one, though.\n                        It is several years after Lucian gets his visit before you hear the knock on your door.\n                        It is late evening when the Distributor finds you at your home. The rap at the door startles you from your half-awake state in the apartment where you now live alone. You rub your eyes and stand slowly from the couch, more than a little bewildered. Maybe Ellen had left something while she’d been visiting, you think. Under this assumption, you twist deadbolt and pull open the door without bothering to check the peephole.\n                        Your heart seems to falter for a moment as you regard the figure beyond the threshold, who is unfamiliar but you know all at once.\n                        The Distributor is nothing like you imagined him all your life. He looks normal, too normal, so much so that he has bypassed it the whole concept of normalcy into a sort of charade. His clothes are street casual, but don’t seem to fit him correctly, too baggy around his shoulders and too tight around his legs. The man before you is older, but still seems much too young to be the same Distributor who has appeared to everyone in town for as long as anyone can remember. There are light crow’s feet by his pale blue eyes, which shine unnaturally despite the darkness outside. Parentheses surround his mouth. Those lines curve outwards at your appearance in the door.\n                        “Good evening,” he says in a pleasant tone. Your eyes trail down to the bag which hangs over his shoulder. The weight of what lies inside the bag hits you suddenly, and your hand clenches over the doorknob as you stutter out a ‘good evening’ in reply. Without a doubt that the man before you is the one you have wondered about for so long, you move backwards to allow him entrance into your apartment. He tips his head towards you and steps inside. You eye him as he wanders through your small place, looking about curiously. He takes his bag to the dining room table and sets it down. There is definitely something otherworldly about him, you think, but then again maybe it’s just the intrigue that has surrounded him for so long that makes you think so.\n                        “I trust you know why I’m here,” he says in that same unassuming tone without looking at you. He is pulling things out of his bag and putting them on the tabletop, but from where you are standing, you cannot see what they are.\n                        You swallow the knot that has formed in your throat.\n                        “What took you so long?” you ask with a forced smile. The Distributor actually laughs here, and turns to look at you.\n                        “I come when you call,” he says cryptically, and you have no idea what he means, because it is past midnight and these days, your Choice is not on your mind all too often. \n                        “Are you sure you’re at the right house?”\n                        “Now more than ever,” the Distributor responds, and gestures you over. You hesitate under his gaze. \n                        There are so many questions that you have wanted to ask all these years, questions that no one but this man has the power to answer. But now that he stands here in your home for the first and what is sure to be the only time, your mind is blank. You struggle to find something to demand of him, but nothing comes.\n                        You find yourself at his side moments later, and an uneasiness has settled over you as you stare down at the three objects he has placed on the table.\n                        A pocket watch. A hand mirror. A coin.\n                        You look at them for a long time as if trying to discern significance out of each of the items. You certainly feel like you’re missing something, by the excited look the Distributor is giving you.\n                        For a long time, you had pictured this moment, but this… This feels so abrupt, so underwhelming, so unceremonious. And you have no idea what you’re supposed to be looking for.\n                        “I- … Do I have to choose now?”\n                        “Don’t look so overwhelmed,” the man says, “It should be a natural choice. It’s not something that needs to be overthought.”\n                        You return your attention to the table and reach out a hand. ",
